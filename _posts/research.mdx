## Alignment and Quantification Techniques for Non-Canonical Splice Sites in Next-Gen RNA-Seq. Data
### Smith College - Northampton, MA

#### SUMMARY:
- Focused on de novo alignment algorithms for non-canonical and alternative splice sites in RNA-Seq data, as
current methods are quite biased towards canonical transcriptions
- Statistical modeling of underlying mechanisms behind epigenetic drift and transcriptional regulation

#### CONCLUSION:
Trained Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) used for unsupervised pseudoalignment of RNA- Seq reads produces low bias for canonical splice sites and provides a basis for complex system modeling of the underlying transcriptional regulation pathways by analyzing the state transition matricies

## Lexicase Selection of Deep Neural Network Weights and Biases
### University of Massachusetts - Amherst, MA

#### SUMMARY:
- Designed a genetic algorithm that employed a lexicase selection algorithm on the weight matrices and bias
modifiers of a population of roughly 20 simple neural networks
- Utilized evolutionary computation to optimize stochastic decent with the goal of simulating object function
smoothing without manipulating the prediction data

#### CONCLUSION:
While computationally costly, small scale tests on the MINST handwriting database found that the genetic algoritm more quickly and reliably optimized the SGD parameters when compared to classic backpropagation alone.

## Physiological Transduction Pathway Analysis
### University of Iowa - Iowa City, IA

#### SUMMARY:
- Researched artificial intelligence algorithms to track and sort radioactive beads through 2D CT scans of pig lungs
- End goal was to provide a novel method for mapping the internal physiology of the lungs

#### CONCLUSION:
LSTMs were more accurate than RNNs and less costly than GRUs at tracking ~100 beads through 10 minutes of video - the output seemed to “forget” beads resulting in less switching when the beads crossed paths

## AAV4 Transduction Pathway for Genetic Therapy
### University of Iowa - Iowa City, IA

#### SUMMARY:
- Created an algorithm that quantified transduction and transfection proliferation transcripts marked with eGFP and mCherry, decreasing the time between experiemnts
- Automated the analysis of microscopy data using two-way ANOVAs and two-tailed T-tests with bias correction

#### CONCLUSION:
Electrotransformation was the most efficient for preparing the viral vectors, and nebulization of the virus with a pH buffer best transfected the airways completely. This specific gene therepy showed potential to decrease the liklihood of recurrent penumonia in animals with cystic fibrosis. Further analysis found a decrease in the transcription activation of complementary system regulators as well as a decrease in longterm airway surface liquid pH.
